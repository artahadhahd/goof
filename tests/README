instructions to build test:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

if it failed to build for you, you probably forgot to clone the catch2 repo.
make sure that you're inside tests/, and run the following command to fix the issue:

git clone --depth 1 -b v2.x https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2

Then you can run the build instructions


A test is needed for every new module added to the project.
Test-driven development is highly recommended.
